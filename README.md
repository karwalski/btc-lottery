# btc-lottery

A simple fun generator of bitcoin wallets, checks to see if the public key matches one of the top 10k biggest wallets.

Uses a static list of wallets, and balances will change over time.

Coded for fun, use responsibly at your own risks
Do not use where you do not have permission to run

What are the chances?
Almost impossible, yet possible
More than all of the grains of sand on earth, yet less then all of the atoms in the universe

Why try?
The Birthday Paradox + Luck + Fun
